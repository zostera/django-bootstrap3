Bootstrap 3 integration for Django.

Goal
----

The goal of this project is to seamlessly blend Django and Bootstrap 3.

**Want to use Bootstrap 4 in Django?**

See https://github.com/zostera/django-bootstrap4.


Requirements
------------

- Python >= 3.5, Django >= 2.1 (see also https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/faq/install/#faq-python-version-support)

Need older versions?
++++++++++++++++++++

- Version 11.x.x can be used for Python 2.7.x with Django 1.11, but you are encouraged to upgrade.

If you need even older versions, this is our history of dropping support for Python and Django versions. Note that this information is "as is", and you should really update to newer Python and Django versions. Using unsupported versions will lead to security risks and broken software.

- *The latest version supporting Django 2.0 is 11.x.x.*
- *The latest version supporting Django < 1.11 is 9.x.x.*
- *The latest version supporting Python 2.6 and Django < 1.8 is 6.x.x.*

1. Install using pip:

   ``pip install django-bootstrap3``

   Alternatively, you can install download or clone this repo and call ``pip install -e .``.

2. Add to INSTALLED_APPS in your ``settings.py``:

3. In your templates, load the ``bootstrap3`` library and use the ``bootstrap_*`` tags:
